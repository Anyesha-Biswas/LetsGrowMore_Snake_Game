AIM : Create a Snake Game using Python.
With older Nokia phones we had an old age addiction with the snake game but of course we don't have it anymore.
What if you could write one for yourself using Python.
Beginner Python programs were interested in making something easier in their domain can definitely try this out.
And the module 'turtle' was built specifically for beginners to try and submit as part of the project the project will be done in Python 3.
 We'll use the curses library to create the game.
 This code creates a simple snake game where you can control the snake using the arrow keys. 
 The game will end if the snake hits the screen border or runs into itself. 
 The goal of the game is to eat as much food as possible to grow the snake's length.

To run the code, copy and paste it into a code cell in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook and press "Shift" + "Enter". 
The game will start in the same code cell.

Note: The curses library is not available on Windows by default. You can install it using the windows-curses package from PyPI using pip install windows-curses. 
However, the package may not work properly in some cases. 
If you're using Windows, I recommend using a virtual environment or a cloud-based IDE like Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook to run the code.
